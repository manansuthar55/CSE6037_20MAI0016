## Task 1:
Build a single perceptron which takes x1 ad x2 two input variables for a training data of 3 samples with corresponding labeled output y and in return perceptron has to learn weights w1 and w2, with bias b also. Later, a test sample is given to predict the label. (Simple one click run in python notebook)

## Task 2:
Use inbulit function MLPClassifier for understading the working the multilayer perceptron network with input as a publicly available dataset in xlsx format. (Dataset directly fetched from UCI dataset repository)

## Task 3:
1. read image from folder  
2. load in the numpy array or in excel (display some images)  
3. extract feature from step using builtin fun  (top 5 image feature and its label)
4. split train and test
5. learning algorihm
6. test (display test image with accuracy) 7. accuracy score, Precision, recall , F1-score
