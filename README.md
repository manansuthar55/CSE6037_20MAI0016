## Assessment_1
### Task 1:
Build a single perceptron which takes x1 ad x2 two input variables for a training data of 3 samples with corresponding labeled output y and in return perceptron has to learn weights w1 and w2, with bias b also. Later, a test sample is given to predict the label. (Simple one click run in python notebook)

### Task 2:
Use inbulit function MLPClassifier for understading the working the multilayer perceptron network with input as a publicly available dataset in xlsx format. (Dataset directly fetched from UCI dataset repository)

### Task 3:
1. Read image from folder(Dataset present in img_dataset.zip)  
2. Load in the numpy array or in excel (display some images)  
3. Extract feature from step using builtin fun  (top 5 image feature and its label)
4. Split train and test dataset
5. Learning algorihm
6. Testing data
7. Accuracy score, Precision, Recall , F1-score 

## Assessment_2
### Task 1:
Demonstrate activation functions used in a Neural Network.
1. Binary Step
2. Tanh
3. ReLU
4. LReLU
5. ELU
6. Swish
7. Softmax

### Task 2:
Use inbulit function MLPClassifier for understading the working the multilayer perceptron network with input as a publicly available dataset in xlsx format. (Dataset directly fetched from UCI dataset repository)
